<p><b>NOTICE REGARDING WELLNESS PROGRAM</b></p>
<p>{{ account }} has a voluntary wellness program available to all employees. The program is administered according to federal rules permitting employer-sponsored wellness programs that seek to improve employee health or prevent disease, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as applicable, among others. If you choose to participate in the wellness program, you will be asked to complete a voluntary health risk assessment or 'HRA' that asks a series of questions about your health-related activities and behaviors and whether you have or had certain medical conditions (e.g., cancer, diabetes, or heart disease). You will also be asked to complete a biometric screening, which will include a blood test for blood sugar and cholesterol. You are not required to complete the HRA or to participate in the blood test or other medical examinations.</p>
<p>However, employees who choose to participate in the wellness program may receive an incentive of a Wellness Participation Rate on Health Insurance for completing the Health Risk Assessment and the Biometric Screening. Although you are not required to complete the HRA or participate in the biometric screening, only employees who do so will be eligible for the Wellness Participation Rate.</p>
<p>If you are unable to participate in any of the health-related activities or achieve any of the health outcomes required to earn an incentive, you may be entitled to a reasonable accommodation or an alternative standard. You may request a reasonable accommodation or an alternative standard by contacting Human Resources.</p>
<p>The information from your HRA and the results from your biometric screening will be used to provide you with information to help you understand your current health and potential risks, and may also be used to offer you services through the wellness program, such as health coaching.  You also are encouraged to share your results or concerns with your own doctor.</p>
