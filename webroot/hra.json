Without consistent “fuel” through food, your body switches into starvation mode, thereby conserving calories and slowing metabolism, which may be linked to weight gain. Further, your body may start using muscle protein for fuel, which shifts body composition to burn even fewer calories at rest. Studies have linked breakfast in particular to increased risk of obesity, and individuals with diabetes are at heightened risk of unstable blood glucose if they skip meals. Finally, your brain suffers, making mood swings likely and clear thinking a significant challenge."
